#A project to reduce the logistical overhead of translating the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto.

The directory structure of the project will mirror the directory structure of the texts in Interfaith Explorer. The assumption is that those files are the source material. All translations should come from the English version, unless no English version exists.

Commit comments generally should be in English, followed by an Esperanto translation. Feel free to cheat and use Google Translate or similar to generate the translation, whether you are writing in Esperanto and translating to English, or vice versa. Please place the English translation on top. Comments should be in the present tense; e.g., "Corrects translation of (X) in (document Y.)"

We are working under the assumptions that:

1. Translations of the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto were explicitly authorized and encouraged by Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi.
2. Everyone involved in this effort will *by definition* need permission to copy and publish modified versions of these documents during translation, so derivative works are *expected* as part of the process.
3. Existing translations that are available on the Internet are a de-facto part of this effort. Most (or possibly all) of them are no longer protected by any sort of copyright, as they were translated very early. That said, if your translation efforts end up as part of this effort against your will, we will happily exclude said work and re-translate it, effectively reducing your hard work to naught. Just let us know if that's really what you want to happen.
4. All of these documents should be considered provisional translations unless otherwise noted.

All documents are expected to be in either Markdown or  Asciidoc formats. 
* GitHub groks both of these formats, and displays them correctly. 
* They are future-proof. 
* Git can track changes in them, because the files are text-based.
* Tools exist to convert both of these formats to nearly any other document format you might imagine.
 

Generally speaking, Markdown is easier and should be the default choice. However, if the original work is a scholarly paper with footnotes, etc., or if the original work is a structured book with sections and chapters, or is otherwise a complex document, then Asciidoc is more suitable. Only one of the two formats should exist in the repository for a given work; if a Markdown document is converted to an Asciidoc format, the Markdown document should be removed, and the Asciidoc document should replace it.

Feel free to contribute. Non-Baha'is are welcome to help. Fork the repo, translate some documents, and do a pull request. If it's good, we'll pull it--simple as that.
