#A project to reduce the logistical overhead of translating the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto.


The completion of translating the entirety of the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto will be the crowning achievement of our lives. Minstrels will sing songs of our glory! Well, perhaps they won't--but it will still be one of the most important accomplishments of this time.

>The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language and one common script. When this is achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own home. These things are obligatory and absolutely essential. *It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action.... That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race.* The Great Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.

>The All Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. *Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.*

>--Baha'u'llah, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, emphasis added.

Many are the calls by Abdu'l-Baha which exhort us to learn Esperanto, spread it everywhere, and teach it to our children. Among these is the directive to translate the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto. The hope is that the completion of these translation efforts will become the catalyst which awakens Baha'is to the task of learning Esperanto and adopting it as our cultural language, and that that adoption in turn will be the spiritual catalyst which causes the nations of the world to adopt an International Auxilliary Language. Lofty aspirations, to be sure! But this act of translation is a concrete act which we can perform in the service of both the Baha'i Faith and mankind.

-----------------

The directory structure of the project will mirror the directory structure of the texts in [Interfaith Explorer](http://www.bahairesearch.com/). The assumption for now is that the files used by Interfaith Explorer are the source material. All translations should come from the English version, unless no English version exists.

Commit comments generally should be in English, followed by an Esperanto translation. Feel free to cheat and use Google Translate or similar to generate the translation, whether you are writing in Esperanto and translating to English, or vice versa. Please place the English translation on top. Comments should be in the present tense; e.g., "Corrects translation of (X) in (document Y.)"

We are working under the assumptions that:

1. Translations of the Baha'i Writings into Esperanto were explicitly authorized and encouraged by Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi.
2. Everyone involved in this effort will *by definition* need permission to copy and publish modified versions of these documents during translation, so derivative works are *expected* as part of the process.
3. Existing translations that are available on the Internet are a de-facto part of this effort. Most (or possibly all) of them are no longer protected by any sort of copyright, as they were translated very early. We do not see it as a conflict of interests to copy any previous translations into this project. Any copyright issues can be dealt with as they come up, but no stakeholders should have any issues with what we are doing, as long as we credit the source of the material.
Gathering all the materials under one project is essential, and the spirit of Bahaâ€™i consultation is to release your ideas/efforts into the community. However, if anyone has a problem with their translation being scraped, we will remove their translation and replace it with a new one.
4. All of these documents should be considered provisional translations unless otherwise noted.

All documents are expected to be in either [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) or [Asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/) formats. 
* GitHub groks both of these formats, and displays them correctly. 
* They are future-proof. 
* Git can track changes in them, because the files are text-based.
* Tools exist to convert both of these formats to nearly any other document format you might imagine.
 

Generally speaking, Markdown is easier and should be the default choice. However, if the original work is a scholarly paper with footnotes, etc., or if the original work is a structured book with sections and chapters, or is otherwise a complex document, then Asciidoc is more suitable. Only one of the two formats should exist in the repository for a given work; if a Markdown document is converted to an Asciidoc format, the Markdown document should be removed, and the Asciidoc document should replace it.

Feel free to contribute. Non-Baha'is are welcome to help. Fork the repo, translate some documents, and do a pull request. If it's good, we'll pull it--simple as that.
